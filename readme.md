# UML Class Diagram Editor

This repository contains a school project developed in C# using Windows Forms. The project focuses on creating a UML class diagram editor, allowing users to design and visualize class diagrams. The application supports importing and exporting class diagrams to files and also provides the capability to generate C# classes based on the designed diagram.

## Features

- UML Class Diagram Editor: The application provides a simple interface for creating, editing, and visualizing UML class diagrams.
- Class Creation and Modification: Users can create classes, define attributes, methods, and relationships between classes, and customize their properties.
- Import and Export: The project supports importing and exporting class diagrams to  files, enabling users to save and share their designs.
- Code Generation: The application allows users to generate C# class files based on the designed UML class diagram, simplifying the process of translating the diagram into code.

## Technologies Used

- C#: The project is developed using C#, a powerful and versatile programming language for building Windows applications.
- Windows Forms: The user interface is built using Windows Forms, providing a familiar and responsive desktop application experience.
- UML Modeling: The project incorporates UML modeling concepts to enable the creation and manipulation of class diagrams.
- File I/O: The application utilizes file input/output operations to import and export class diagrams to  files.
- Code Generation: The project includes code generation functionality to automatically create C# class files based on the designed UML class diagram.
